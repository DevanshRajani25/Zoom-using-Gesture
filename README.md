# Gesture-Based Zoom Using OpenCV & MediaPipe 🚀🖐️

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a real-time gesture-controlled zoom system using OpenCV, cvzone, and MediaPipe. It detects both hands, identifies finger gestures, and calculates the distance between index fingers to dynamically zoom in and out of an image in real-time.

## 🎯 Features
✅ Real-time Hand Tracking using MediaPipe 🖐️<br>
✅ Finger Gesture Recognition for smooth interactions ✋<br>
✅ Dynamic Image Scaling based on finger distance 📏<br>
✅ Computer Vision-Powered Interaction 🔍<br>

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍<br>
OpenCV (for image processing)<br>
cvzone & MediaPipe (for hand tracking)<br>

## 📸 How It Works?<br>
1️⃣ Detects Hands: Identifies both hands and their key landmarks.<br>
2️⃣ Recognizes Gestures: Checks if both index fingers and thumbs are raised.<br>
3️⃣ Calculates Distance: Measures distance between fingertips.<br>
4️⃣ Zooms Dynamically: Resizes and overlays the image based on the finger gap.
